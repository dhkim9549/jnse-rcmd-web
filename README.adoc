== What You Will Build

You will build a webpage which connects directly to HF Open API server bypassing _the Public Data Portal API server_ and.

* Due to the CORS restriction, the webpage uses a proxy server to connect to the HF Open API server.
* To connect to HF Open API server, an API key is necessary.
* API keys are generated by a key generator batch program and the keys are accessed through the API key REST server. (API keys are valid only for a few minutes.)
