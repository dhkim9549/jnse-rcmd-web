== What You Will Build

You will build a webpage which directly calls HF Open API server bypassing _the Public Data Portal API server_.

* Due to the CORS restriction, the webpage uses a proxy server to call HF Open API server.
* An API key is necessary to call HF Open API server.
* API keys are generated by a key generator batch program periodically and stored in database. (API keys are valid only for a few minutes.)
